# Urban-Nest-A-project-on-circadian-rhythm

In this current fast-paced world we often find ourselves immersed in work and spending long hours in closed environments like workspaces or classrooms that can disrupt our circadian rhythm due to insufficient exposure to natural light. Our circadian rhythm is thrown off by this. Circadian Rhythm whose role is to maintain good sleep cycles at night time, telling us when to wake up and to sleep, and make us productive during the day along with many other things will not be able to do so when it is distorted. This project focuses on developing a smart indoor lighting system on enhancing circadian rhythms for optimizing sleep cycles including mood disorder. The device monitors the light intensity in that specific space periodically and alters the light output from the device maintaining a certain amount of light intensity in that specific closed environment. It also provides real-time adjustments to lighting conditions through tunable white light from blue to orange shade of white light from day to night promoting improved sleep at night.
